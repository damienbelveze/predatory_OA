# A doctoral session on Predatory Open Access Publishers

This training session was first proposed to PhD Students affiliated to a member of the *Collège Doctoral de Bretagne* on April, the 12th 2024
It was designed for a two hours sessions, but could be used for a 2,5 hours session ; in that case, PhD students will have more time to test the [Compass to publish tool](https://app.lib.uliege.be/compass-to-publish/)

# Scope

I tried to promote the Compass to publish barometer as a way to combine old strategies (presence of a journal in a white or black list approach) and new ones (hijacking behaviour, observations of the homepage, dubious metrics, previous volumes non available, etc.) and also because their methodology is fully transparent. 

I wanted also to retore some complexity to the concept of predatory open access publishers and question its use in a Global North vs Peripheral Countries perspective, as many authors -included from the Western countries- did before this presentation was made.
Predatory Open Access publishers is not only a black and white question. MDPI for instance stands in the gray zone, some of their journals evolving towards fraudulent practices (inflation of special issues for instance), while some others trying to raise their quality standards to become more legitimate.

# Content of this repository

The presentation is made with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [Rstudio](https://posit.co/) text editor (R distribution must also have been installed on the computer prior to the installation of Rstudio).
This repository contains also h5P files, edited with [Logiquiz](https://ladigitale.dev/logiquiz/) (from The Digitale) and stored and managed directly through Github (see methodology on [Tupananda's repo](https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone) and [Camilo Mora](https://github.com/Camilo-Mora/H5P?tab=readme-ov-file)'s additional explanations on how to use Tupananda's H5P standalone script )
In order to reuse and edit the content, you may add other h5P activities under H5P folder, referring to them in a specific html page (see metrics.html for instance)
In order to edit the text of the presentation, you will need Quarto and a text editor (VS Code or Rstudio installed on your computer)

the [digiboard](https://digiboard.app/b/061c10526e4a2) can be opened and cleaned. in order to access the board, answer to the question "my favorite word" with *echancrure* (which was the François Cheng's french favorite word, by the way)

# Known issues

the h5P "metrics" activity does not work properly from the online presentation. The Citefactor frame cannot be moved ; once a frame is moved, it cannot be moved again without the page being refreshed
You may use insteald the [standalone version of this activity](https://damienbelveze.github.io/predatory_OA/metrics.html), which correctly works (scroll to make the "validate" and "check" button appear).
